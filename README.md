Woovers is a in-memory NodeJS lightweight tool based on Express.js for mimicking the Woovi/OpenPIX api easily without needing to have any active access key. In development.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This tool is not associated with Woovi/OpenPIX, therefore it is not official and it is not guaranted to have any kind of support to existing or new functionalities. The code is open-source and only mimics the official API behaviour without its nuances.
