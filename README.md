Woovers is a in-memory NodeJS lightweight server based on Express.js for mimicking the Woovi/OpenPIX api easily without needing to have any active access key. It is meant to have all the basic functionality in one run with QRCode generation (not valid pix codes), webhooks and other functionalities. In development.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This tool is not associated with Woovi/OpenPIX, therefore it is not official and it is not guaranted to have any kind of support to existing or new functionalities. The code is open-source and only mimics the official API behaviour without its nuances. 

## Usage

```bash
> yarn install
> yarn go
```
